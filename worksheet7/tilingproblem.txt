a) For Brute Force, exceeds over 1s at 20
   For Memorization, doesn't exceed over 1s even at 1000
   For Dynamic Programming, doesn't exceed over 1s even at 1000

b) 10000

c) Dynamic Programming has no recursion limit, and it has slightly better performance. Since, it has no recursion limit, it can run up to some point until the system limits.
    The reason for that advantage is dynamic programming uses iteration loop while memorization uses recursive function.
